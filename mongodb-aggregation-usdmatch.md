# MongoDB Aggregation $match

### Introduction

The `$match` stage in MongoDB's aggregation framework is used to filter documents based on specified criteria. It is similar to the `find` operation in MongoDB but is used within the context of an aggregation pipeline. The `$match` stage helps you narrow down the dataset before further processing, making your aggregation queries more efficient.

### Prerequisites

* MongoDB installed and running on your machine.
* Access to `mongosh` and a populated database with sample data.

### Step 1: Start `mongosh`

1. **Open Terminal/Command Prompt:**
   * Launch your terminal (macOS/Linux) or command prompt (Windows).
2. **Start `mongosh`:**
   *   Type the following command and press Enter:

       ```bash
       mongosh
       ```

### Step 2: Switch to the Database

Switch to the database where your collection is located.

1.  **Use a Database:**

    ```javascript
    use myNewDatabase
    ```

### Step 3: Sample Data

Letâ€™s assume you have a collection named `sales` with documents that look like this:

```json
{ "_id": 1, "item": "apple", "quantity": 5, "price": 2, "category": "fruit" }
{ "_id": 2, "item": "banana", "quantity": 10, "price": 1, "category": "fruit" }
{ "_id": 3, "item": "carrot", "quantity": 7, "price": 1.5, "category": "vegetable" }
{ "_id": 4, "item": "orange", "quantity": 3, "price": 3, "category": "fruit" }
{ "_id": 5, "item": "broccoli", "quantity": 4, "price": 2.5, "category": "vegetable" }
```

### Step 4: Using `$match`

#### 1. Basic Usage of `$match`

To filter documents based on a specific condition, you can use the `$match` stage. For example, if you want to find all items in the `fruit` category:

```javascript
db.sales.aggregate([
  { $match: { category: "fruit" } }
])
```

**Output:**

```json
{ "_id": 1, "item": "apple", "quantity": 5, "price": 2, "category": "fruit" }
{ "_id": 2, "item": "banana", "quantity": 10, "price": 1, "category": "fruit" }
{ "_id": 4, "item": "orange", "quantity": 3, "price": 3, "category": "fruit" }
```

#### 2. Using Comparison Operators

You can use various comparison operators in the `$match` stage. For example, to find items with a quantity greater than 5:

```javascript
db.sales.aggregate([
  { $match: { quantity: { $gt: 5 } } } // $gt is the greater than operator
])
```

**Output:**

```json
{ "_id": 2, "item": "banana", "quantity": 10, "price": 1, "category": "fruit" }
{ "_id": 3, "item": "carrot", "quantity": 7, "price": 1.5, "category": "vegetable" }
```

#### 3. Using Logical Operators

Logical operators like `$and`, `$or`, and `$not` can be used to combine multiple conditions. For example, to find items that are either in the `fruit` category or have a price less than 2:

```javascript
db.sales.aggregate([
  { 
    $match: { 
      $or: [
        { category: "fruit" },
        { price: { $lt: 2 } }
      ] 
    } 
  }
])
```

**Output:**

```json
{ "_id": 1, "item": "apple", "quantity": 5, "price": 2, "category": "fruit" }
{ "_id": 2, "item": "banana", "quantity": 10, "price": 1, "category": "fruit" }
{ "_id": 3, "item": "carrot", "quantity": 7, "price": 1.5, "category": "vegetable" }
{ "_id": 4, "item": "orange", "quantity": 3, "price": 3, "category": "fruit" }
```

#### 4. Combining `$match` with Other Stages

The `$match` stage can be combined with other aggregation stages for more complex queries. For example, if you want to find items in the `fruit` category and then sort them by `price`:

```javascript
db.sales.aggregate([
  { $match: { category: "fruit" } }, // Filter by category
  { $sort: { price: 1 } } // Sort by price in ascending order
])
```

**Output:**

```json
{ "_id": 2, "item": "banana", "quantity": 10, "price": 1, "category": "fruit" }
{ "_id": 1, "item": "apple", "quantity": 5, "price": 2, "category": "fruit" }
{ "_id": 4, "item": "orange", "quantity": 3, "price": 3, "category": "fruit" }
```

### Conclusion

You have learned how to use the `$match` stage in MongoDB's aggregation framework to filter documents based on specified criteria. The `$match` stage is essential for refining your dataset and can be used in combination with other stages to create complex aggregation queries.
